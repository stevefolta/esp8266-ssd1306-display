"The ESP8266 is a microcontroller from Chinese manufacturer Espressif that "
"includes Wi-Fi capability.\n"
"\n"
"The chip first came to the attention of western makers in August 2014 with the "
"ESP-01. This small board allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network "
"and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes-style commands. However, at the "
"time there was almost no English-language documentation on the chip and the "
"commands it accepted. The very low price and the fact that there were very "
"little external components on the module which suggests that it could "
"eventually be very inexpensive in volume, attracted many hackers to explore the "
"module, chip, and the software on it, as well as to translate the Chinese "
"documentation.\n"
"\n"
"In late October 2014, Espressif released a software development kit (SDK) that "
"allowed the chip to be programmed, removing the need for a separate "
"microcontroller. Since then, there have been many official SDK releases from "
"Espressif; Espressif maintains two versions of the SDK â€” one that is based on "
"RTOS and the other, based on callbacks.\n"
"\n"
"An alternative to Espressif's official SDK is the open source esp-open-sdk that "
"is based on the GCC toolchain. ESP8266 uses the Cadence Tensilica LX106 "
"microcontroller and the GCC toolchain is open-sourced and maintained by Max "
"Filippov.\n";
